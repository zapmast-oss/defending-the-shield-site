						Next time, he'll call a mechanic. During an afternoon off from team activities, <a href="../players/player_1060.html">David Lopez</a> had hoped to finish some chores around the house, then drive into town to pick out some new furniture. When he opened his garage, however, he found his front tire, slumped and defeated, punctured with a tenpenny nail from nearby construction. Rather than admit defeat, Lopez set to work fixing the problem - a mindset he says has served him well throughout his career. "It's how I was raised. Have a problem? Find a solution. Swing and miss? Next time, swing harder. Get a flat tire? Go find a jack and get down to it. It's not rocket science," said the 36 year old left fielder, gesturing with his crutches.<br><br>Unfortunately for his teammates, that can-do attitude didn't coincide with safety-first sensibility. "I had the spare on, started cranking on the lugnuts, and somehow my foot slipped and caught the jack. I fell, I heard a metal on metal, and bam! It happened so fast, I couldn't see what happened. All I knew was, my foot felt like it was off my leg!"<br><br>It seems as though when <a href="../players/player_1060.html">Lopez</a> fell, something caused the jack to come loose, and down came 3,000 pounds of automotive fury on one unsuspecting size-13 shoe. <br><br>"Hurt like a sonofagun. I don't mind saying: I cried and yelled at that car for five minutes while I tried to get the wheel off my foot. I screamed at it like it killed my dog," laughed Lopez, who later admitted to feeling glad he could laugh at his misfortune. <br><br>"I'm just glad it didn't land on my head." Early reports are saying he will be out about 8 weeks with a fractured foot.
